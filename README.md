KOF Survival City Cheats and Codes for gems Hacks full guide - When you are ready, cut down the tree above the dwarf on your right hand until you meet the old man. Talk to him and start the monster spawning on the island. These monsters - mostly skeletons - will make your life more difficult. They will wander around and steal the resources on the ground.
